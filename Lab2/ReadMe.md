# **Objective 1: Activities to revisit Java**

This objective was just a revision of java so that this concept of java could help in upcoming lab. A simple task class was created consisting of two methods and creating the object of the class those methods were called and used.

# **Objective 2: Factory Pattern Design Implementation**
# **Theory :**

Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

# **Objective 3: Singleton Pattern**

# **Theory :**
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

# **Objective 4: Abstract Class Concept**
# **Theory :**

A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

Points to Remember:
An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It cannot be instantiated.
It can have constructors and static methods also.
It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
