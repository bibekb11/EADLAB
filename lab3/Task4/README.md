# Abstract class concept

### Theory : 

A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract methods(methods without body) as well as concrete methods (regular methods with body). A normal class(non-abstract class) cannot have abstract methods. In this guide we will learn what is a abstract class, why we use it and what are the rules that we must remember while working with it in Java.

An abstract class can not be instantiated, which means you are not allowed to create an object of it.
